# View Source Code of Conduct

## Underlying Philosophy

We want this to be an inclusive space for all the different people who are involve in making things on the web (and those who are interested in the web and surrounding technologies). To that end, we ask you that you consider the way you interact and in some cases choose to change the way you behave to help make this an inclusive place.

We want to prioritise our community over ourselves. That includes prioritising other people being heard and accepted over ourselves being thought as smart or funny. That isn't always comfortable, but we try.

Together we acknowledge that we are all growing, and we will all from time to time make mistakes. This does not excuse any bad behaviour, but we ask that we all draw each other onwards and upwards.
